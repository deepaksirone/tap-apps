//

// 
// startTime is the first time when the action can happen
// stopTime  is the last time the action can happen... until time
//    reaches the next startTime.
//
// Notes:
//   - startTime can be later than stopTime. For example, startTime
//        can be 10:00pm and stopTime 06:00am. This means actions can
//        happen from 10pm of one day until 6am of the next day but
//        not between 6am and 10pm of either day.
//
//   - startTime cannot be the same as stopTime
//
//   - 'Skip' messages are written when the service's action does not
//        happen, such as after the stopTime and before the next
//        start time.
//
//   - If you want to use this code with a service other than
//        Gmail.sendYourselfAnEmail, you must change the lines that
//        reference Gmail.sendYourselfAnEmail.skip to the skip method
//        for your service.
